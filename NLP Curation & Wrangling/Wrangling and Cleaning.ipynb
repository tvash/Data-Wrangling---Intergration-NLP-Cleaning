    "This project gave us the insight of getting data from semisturctured data and how to munge/wrangle it. It uses a real world example of wrangling a data which helps us understand better the workings of wrangling. We also come to understand that even in semi-structured Data is not always similar in pattern and newer more adaptive techniques should be used tackle such issues. We also learnt real world data format like JSON and XML and how to write them using python giving it format."
